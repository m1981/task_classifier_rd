# User Scenario: Task Batching for Efficiency

## Scenario: Cross-Project Task Batching

### User Context:
David manages multiple renovation projects across his home and his son's new condo. He has dozens of tasks scattered throughout different project categories in his system. Many small painting touch-ups and carpentry fixes are distributed across various rooms and properties.

### Pain Point:
David realizes he's being inefficient by setting up, cleaning, and storing the same tools repeatedly when he works on similar tasks on different days for different projects.

### Using the Task Classifier AI:

1. **Cross-Project Discovery**
   David selects "Find Similar Tasks" and chooses "Painting" as the task type. The AI immediately identifies 14 painting-related tasks scattered across:
   - Master bedroom touch-ups (Home)
   - Kitchen cabinet repainting (Home)
   - Baseboard touch-ups in three rooms (Home)
   - Front door repainting (Home)
   - Bathroom ceiling spot repair (Son's Condo)
   - Accent wall completion (Son's Condo)

2. **Material & Tool Analysis**
   The AI analyzes these tasks and generates:
   - A consolidated list of required paints (noting which colors are needed for which tasks)
   - Complete tool requirements (brushes, rollers, drop cloths, painter's tape, etc.)
   - Estimated total time to complete all painting tasks (4.5 hours)
   - Suggested sequence based on dry time and location

3. **Batch Creation**
   David selects "Create Batch" and the app:
   - Creates a new "Painting Batch - Weekend of May 15" container
   - Groups all selected tasks while maintaining their connections to original projects
   - Generates a shopping list for missing supplies
   - Suggests an efficient order of operations (starting with ceilings, then walls, then trim)

4. **Similar Process for Carpentry**
   David repeats the process for carpentry tasks, discovering:
   - 8 carpentry-related tasks across both properties
   - Common tools needed for all tasks
   - Materials required, organized by task
   - Estimated time (3 hours)

5. **Schedule Optimization**
   The app suggests:
   - Doing all painting tasks on Saturday (allowing for dry time between coats)
   - Scheduling carpentry tasks for Sunday
   - A reminder to prepare all surfaces the evening before

6. **Completion Tracking**
   As David completes each task in the batch:
   - The original projects are automatically updated
   - Progress is tracked across both properties
   - The system learns which tasks are commonly batched together for future suggestions

### Benefits Highlighted:
- 60% reduction in setup/cleanup time
- Single trip to the hardware store instead of multiple visits
- Complete visibility of similar tasks across projects
- Efficient use of materials (less waste from partially used supplies)
- Satisfaction of completing multiple small tasks in focused work sessions



### User Guidance
Best Practices to Show Users:
- "Be specific: 'Fix bathroom sink' vs 'Fix'"
- "One task per line: Split complex tasks"
- "Review low-confidence results manually"
- "Add projects if many tasks are 'unmatched'"
