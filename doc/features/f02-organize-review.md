# Feature F-02: Organize & Review (Planning Mode)

## Value Proposition
To structure projects hierarchically under Goals and manage non-actionable support materials (Shopping/Reference) so they don't clutter the task list.

## Data Hierarchy
Goal -> Project -> [Tasks, Shopping List, Reference Items]

## User Stories
*   **US-2.1 Goal Dashboard:** As a user, I want to see my active Goals (e.g., "Renovate Kitchen") to ensure I'm working on the right things.
*   **US-2.2 Project Container:** As a user, clicking a Goal shows its Projects.
*   **US-2.3 Support Lists:** As a user, inside a Project, I want separate lists for:
    *   **Shopping:** Things to buy (with checkboxes).
    *   **Reference:** Links/Notes (read-only or text blobs).
    *   **Tasks:** Actionable steps (linked to F-03).
*   **US-2.4 Weekly Review:** As a user, I want to re-order projects or move tasks between lists during my review.
