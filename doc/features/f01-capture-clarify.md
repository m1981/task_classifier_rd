# Feature F-01: Capture & Clarify (Inbox Mode)

## Value Proposition
To empty the user's brain into a trusted system and rapidly process vague thoughts into concrete items using AI.

## User Stories
*   **US-1.1 Quick Capture:** As a user, I can add a raw text string to the Inbox from any screen.
*   **US-1.2 AI Triage:** As a user, I want the AI to analyze an inbox item and suggest:
    *   Is it a Project? (Create new Project)
    *   Is it a Task? (Move to existing Project)
    *   Is it Reference/Trash? (Delete or Archive)
*   **US-1.3 One-Touch Processing:** As a user, I want to accept the AI suggestion with a single click to reach "Inbox Zero."

## UI Components
*   **Inbox Counter:** "5 items remaining"
*   **Triage Card:** The central card showing the current item and AI reasoning.
