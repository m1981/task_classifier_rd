# Feature F-03: Engage (Execution Mode)

## Value Proposition
To provide a distraction-free view of *only* actionable tasks, filtered by context, so the user can execute without getting overwhelmed by the full project plans.

## User Stories
*   **US-3.1 Next Actions View:** As a user, I want a flat list of tasks from *all* active projects.
*   **US-3.2 Context Filtering:** As a user, I want to filter by tag (e.g., `@home`, `@computer`, `@errands`).
*   **US-3.3 Do & Done:** As a user, I want to mark a task complete and have it immediately disappear from the view.
