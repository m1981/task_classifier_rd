## Value Proposition
To provide high-level strategic advice, time estimation, and motivation based on the user's actual data.

## User Stories
*   **US-4.1 Time Forecasting:** As a user, I want to know when I will finish a project based on my estimated task durations.
*   **US-4.2 Smart Context (Chat with Data):** As a user, I want to type a natural language query (e.g., "I have 30 mins and low energy") into the Execution View. The AI should analyze my active tasks and return a **filtered list** of items that fit those constraints.
*   **US-4.3 Strategic Review:** As a user, I want the AI to critique my recent completed work against my stated high-level goals.
