# Feature F-04: The AI Coach

## Value Proposition
To provide high-level strategic advice, time estimation, and motivation based on the user's actual data.

## User Stories
*   **US-4.1 Time Forecasting:** As a user, I want to know when I will finish a project based on my estimated task durations and daily availability.
*   **US-4.2 Smart Context (Chat with Data):** As a user, I want to type a natural language query (e.g., "I have 30 mins and low energy") into the Execution View and have the AI filter the task list to show only relevant items.
*   **US-4.3 Strategic Review:** As a user, I want the AI to critique my recent completed work (based on `completed_at` timestamps) against my stated high-level goals.
