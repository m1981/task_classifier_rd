# Feature F-02: Organize & Review (Planning Mode)

## Value Proposition
To structure projects hierarchically under Goals and manage a mixed stream of actionable and support materials within a single view.

## Data Hierarchy
Goal -> Project -> [Unified Stream of Items (Tasks, Resources, References)]

## User Stories
*   **US-2.1 Goal Dashboard:** As a user, I want to see my active Goals to ensure I'm working on the right things.
*   **US-2.2 Project Container:** As a user, clicking a Goal shows its Projects.
*   **US-2.3 Polymorphic Item Entry:** As a user, inside a Project, I want to add different types of items to the same stream:
    *   **Resources:** Things to buy or gather (with store location).
    *   **References:** Links/Notes (read-only).
    *   **Tasks:** Actionable steps (with duration).
*   **US-2.4 Unified Review:** As a user, I want to see these items interleaved chronologically so I can plan the flow of work (e.g., "Buy Paint" -> "Paint Wall").
