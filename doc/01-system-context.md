# System Context: AI-Powered GTD

## Core Philosophy
We follow the 5-step GTD method, augmented by AI to reduce the cognitive load of "Clarifying" and "Organizing."

## The 3 Modes of Operation
1.  **Inbox Mode (Capture & Clarify):** Rapid entry and AI-assisted sorting.
2.  **Planning Mode (Organize & Review):** Aligning Projects with Goals and managing support lists.
3.  **Action Mode (Engage):** A filtered view of what to do *now*.
